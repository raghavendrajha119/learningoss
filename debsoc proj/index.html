Participants have to be quick and witty to make the cut. Last year, Fictionary gathered over 500 participants. Performances were seen from every year, be it first, second, third, or the final year. We got to see a brilliant display of fast thinkers.

                    Ice Breaker was our event to initiate a conversation and to give first years an opportunity to think differently on a bit out-of-the-league topics. Participants were asked to send us their arguments either in support or in opposition, which were posted if they abided by the policies of Facebook. The participants with the maximum likes, comments, and shares plus considering OC’s views were chosen to be the winners.We received more than 120 responses from the first years.

A public speaking workshop, generally conducted at the start of the academic session here helps you overcome all those bouts of stuttering and gives us the confidence boost we all require. The workshop sees massive participation every year, and collects a lot of positive applause as well.
